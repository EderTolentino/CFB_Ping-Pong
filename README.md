# CFB_Ping-Pong

PING PONG
This page was made through the CANAL FESSOR BRUNO - CFB CURSOS, in which Professor Bruno teaches how to create some popular games using several programming languages.

This project consists of creating a ping pong game programmed in JavaScript.

The game works, but I think it could be improved to a more difficult level and to work on a mobile version. Despite the shortcomings, it was very valid for my learning.
